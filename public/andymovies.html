    <h1>The best movies I've ever seen</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Spiderman: across the multiverse</h3>
<p>This is one of my favorite movies because it shows that it's never too late to become someone that you have always
    wanted to be
</p>

<h3>The Batman</h3>
<p>This heroe without superpowers is simply amazing. He's super smart and he can beat anyone with superpowers easily
    if they let him think a master plan.
</p>
<h3>Hachiko</h3>
<p>I don't exactly remember the name of the movie but it's about a super loyal dog, and movies about dogs somehow 
    always make me cry.
